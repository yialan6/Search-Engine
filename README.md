#Search Engine

A search engine application that handles queries and displays results in under 300ms by searching through UCI's Informatics of Computer Science Department's corpus.

# Specifications

main.py - Generates an index for each stemmed word found in the corpus. The index stores a weight for each term, calculated using its tf-idf value and the HTML tag which it is under.

merge.py - Takes all the partial indexes generated from main.py and merges them into one document. A champions list is created containing the top k weighted results for faster queries.

query.py - Takes a query as an input and searches through the champions list for all the documents that contain each term in the query. The highest k weighted documents are returned.

serach_ui.py - A web GUI used to take a query as an input and display its results as an output.
